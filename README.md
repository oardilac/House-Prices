<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is centered around predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. It makes use of Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn to process data, train machine learning models, and predict outcomes. It begins with exploratory data analysis to understand the data and the relationships between different features. It then applies various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines to make predictions.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you get started with the project.

### Prerequisites

The project relies on several Python libraries. Install them with pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib seaborn lightgbm xgboost
```
### Installation

1. Clone the repo

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/oardilac/House-Prices.git
    ```

2. Open the notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook House Prices.ipynb
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can view and modify the project's code in the Jupyter notebook. It's divided into several sections:

1. Importing libraries
2. Loading datasets
3. Feature engineering
4. Data preprocessing
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Residual analysis

You can change the code as needed to suit your needs. For example, you could add or remove steps in the data preprocessing pipeline, experiment with different models or hyperparameters, or use a different evaluation metric.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Here are some potential enhancements for future versions of the project:

- [ ] Experiment with more feature engineering techniques
- [ ] Try different machine learning models or ensemble methods
- [ ] Add a step to handle outliers in the data
- [ ] Use cross-validation for more robust model evaluation
- [ ] Implement a system for automated hyperparameter tuning


See the [open issues](https://github.com/oardilac/House-Prices/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
